<h3>Welcome to the Joined-up Data Standards Navigator </h3>
<p>Directly compare data from multiple international data standards using our
  free translation tools. The tools are designed to make your work easier and
  increase the efficiency of your analysis, so you can concentrate on
  understanding what the data is saying, instead of spending hours joining it up

              As people who work with data on international development and humanitarian financing, we know how complex and time-consuming it can be to compare and work with data published to different standards.
              To solve this problem we’ve created easy-to-use tools so you can explore if and how international development data standards compare, and what relationships exist between them. You can also download our macro to apply our mappings within your own spreadsheets.
              Search and translate: find out if and how data standards compare
              Translate in your spreadsheet: use our Google Sheet Add-on to use our mappings within your own spreadsheet

                For the data you publish to have maximum reach and impact it needs to be easily accessible and useable by those wanting to analyse it. By adding your standard to our network, you will:
                make it easier for data users to put your data to good use
                show how your standard relates to others
                support interoperability across different organisations and sectors.
                It’s easy to add your standard and you only have to do it once to plug in to the network we’ve already mapped.
                The more standards that join, the more useful the tools become to those needing to analyse data, and the more impact your data can have. So get in touch to find out more about how to add your standard to the Joined-up Data Standards Navigator.
